## âœ¨ About the Project

This is a concept design for a **desktop landing page** focused on NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). The page is designed to allow users to **discover, collect, and sell rare NFTs** while providing features like **built-in analytics** and **testimonials** to build trust and engagement.

The visual style emphasizes **modern gradients**, **minimalism**, and **futuristic elements** to match the tech-forward theme of Web3.
